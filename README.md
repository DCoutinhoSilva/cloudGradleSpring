### Detailed Setup

1. Clone this repo

2. Edit custom activity configuration
    * Open config.js file
    * Replace all placeholders as follows:
        * YOUR APPLICATION EXTENSION KEY HERE
        * TYPE, FOR CUSTOM SPLIT ACTIVITY USE RESTDECISION
        * CUSTOM ACTIVITY NAME
        * CUSTOM ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
        * URL OF THE SERVER RUNNING THE BACKEND

    * If you aren't creating a custom aplit activity, remove the attribute "outcomes" else configure each path as you want.

3. Customize configuration screen logic 
    * Open index.html and customActivity.js files
